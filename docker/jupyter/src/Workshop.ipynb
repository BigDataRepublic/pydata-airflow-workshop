These steps are very generic and will be performed by many ML pipelines built on Airflow. The only custom logic is the `train_model` function. When using the `S3FileTransformOperator`, everyone who wants to train a model has to write the generic code over and over again. This is not very elegant, more work, and error prone.\n",
