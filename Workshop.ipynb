The second script, `train.py`, takes a CSV with preprocessed training data, and outputs a pickled machine learning model. Also, you are provided with an S3 bucket containing our raw training data.

The connection to your bucket is already setup for you, and has the name 's3'. This name is specified in the operators, to let Airflow know which connection to use. \n",
