    "In this assignment, we are going to schedule a simple workflow on Airflow to get used with the concepts. Airflow uses the following concepts for worfklows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DAG ([directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)): a description of the order in which work should take place\n",
    "- Operator: a class that acts as a template for carrying out some work\n",
    "- Task: a parameterized instance of an operator\n",
    "- Task Instance: a task that \n",
    "     1. has been assigned to a DAG and \n",
    "     2. has a state associated with a specific run of the DAG\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below defines a DAG (directed acyclic graph) in Airflow. The DAG has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The DAG starts on 2019-11-27 and runs every day at midnight\n",
    "- This DAG covers 2 tasks. 1 of them is an instance of [`PythonOperator`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.10.4/airflow/operators/python_operator.py)s, and 1 is an instance of the [`BashOperator`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.10.4/airflow/operators/bash_operator.py). Both tasks will simply print a word to the logs.\n",

    "\n",
    "> The bitshift operator `>>` is overloaded for operators in Airflow. It is used to define dependencies between tasks in a DAG. For more information about defining relationships between tasks, check out the [bitshift composition](https://airflow.apache.org/concepts.html#bitshift-composition) and [relationship helper](https://airflow.apache.org/concepts.html#relationship-helper) in the Airflow documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is everything we need to do to define a DAG that can be scheduled on Airflow. Because DAGs are defined using Python, we have a lot of freedom in how we want to design our DAG. We could, for example, dynamically create tasks by looping over lists. Furthermore, defining your DAGs as code makes it it easy to keep track on their version in a source code management system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to actually run this example on Airflow. The Airflow scheduler periodically scans a folder, called 'the DagBag', for files that define DAGs. There is a folder in this jupyter notebook server, called `dags`, which is also present at the airflow scheduler via a network file system. Any python file that we put there, will be picked up by the scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Copy the code snippet above. Go to the dags folder in the file explorer, press the 'New' button in the upper right corner, and create a **Text File**. Name it `hello_world.py`. The name of the file is flexible, but should end with `.py`. Paste the copied code inside.\n",
    "- Go to port 8080 of your personal load balancer (you are now on 8888). Your DAG should appear within a few seconds.\n",
    "- The DAG is turned off at first. Turn it on and frequently refresh the page to see what happens. In the 'Recent Tasks' and 'DAG Runs' columns, you will see the circles changing. Hover over them to see what they mean. After a while, only the leftmost, dark green circles are filled. They show that all tasks and DAGs have completed successfully.\n",
    "- Click on 'hello_world' in the 'DAG' column. You are brought to the tree view, showing all DAG runs and task instances and their status. They are all dark green, meaning they all completed successfully. \n",
    "- Press the lower left square, which is the 'print_hello' task instance of the DAG run of 27-11-2019. You will see a menu with various actions that can be performed on the task instance. Press 'View Log'. This brings you to the logs produced by the task instance. We can also see that is has printed 'hello', as we expected from this task instance.\n",
    "- Click on 'Graph View'. Here we can see the graphical representation of our DAG. We can see that 'print_hello' is followed by 'print_world', as we defined this in the DAG definition above.\n",
